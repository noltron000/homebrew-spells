## Description
You wrangle lightning energy into a lash of semi-physical form.
The lash forms in your free hand, and lasts for the duration.
The lash has the same statistics as a regular whip with the following changes:
- The whip deals `1d4` lightning damage on a hit.
- The whip has a reach of 15 feet.
- If you hit a creature that is within 5 feet of you with this whip, it deals an extra `1d4` lightning damage.

If you let go of the whip or cast this spell again, the weapon disappears, and the spell ends.
