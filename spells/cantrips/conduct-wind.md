## Description
You conduct an area of wind, which must fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
You can guide the wind in one of the following ways:
- You focus this spell on a creature or object that you can see within the spell's area, weaponizing the wind around it as you desire.
	The target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or take `1d4` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).
- You focus this spell on a creature or object that you can see within the spell's area, attempting to blow them aside with a strong gust.
	The target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice.
	The target must be *medium* or smaller, otherwise it automatically succeeds on this Saving Throw.
- You create some harmless sensory effect using the air&mdash;such as causing airy flourishes in your clothes or hair, blasting doors open or closed, or rustling foliage in the area.
	This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
