## Description
You touch three stones and imbue them with magic.
A stone's magic lasts for the duration.
You or someone else can take a stone and use it in a Weapon Attack.
If used as a sort of cudgel, a stone acts as an improvised weapon.
If used as ammunition, it can be used normally with a sling or a similar weapon that hurls stones.
In either case, an attack with a magic stone has the following properties:
- A magic stone deals magical bludgeoning damage.
- Attacks with a magic stone have a magical bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your spellcasting ability modifier (rounded down).

The magic on a stone dissipates after it is used in an attack.
The spell ends when there are no more stones affected by its magic, or if you cast it again.
You can dismiss the magic on any number of stones at any time (no action required).
