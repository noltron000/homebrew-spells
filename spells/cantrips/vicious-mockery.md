## Description
You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range.
If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it takes `1d4` psychic damage and has disadvantage on all Attack Rolls until the end of your next turn.
