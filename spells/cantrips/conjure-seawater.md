## Description
You conjure a chilled ocean mist inside a 1-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range, which obscures its area.
Any water or air that enters the cube's space slowly becomes cold and briny.

Once per round, you can cause the cube to spout 5 gallons of saltwater as a bonus action.
The water spills and pours from the cube unless there is something to contain it.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the cube generates 5 more gallons of saltwater per round for each slot level.
