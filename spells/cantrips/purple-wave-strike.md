## Description
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a Melee Attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.
On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn.
If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes `1d8` thunder damage, and the spell ends.

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.
At 5th level, the Melee Attack deals an extra `1d8` thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to `2d8`.
Both damage rolls increase by `1d8` at 11th level and 17th level.
