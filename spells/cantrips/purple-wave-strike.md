## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
The weapon is sheathed in purple, gleaming energy until the end of your next turn.
The first time you make an attack using this weapon before then, it unleashes its booming energy upon your target, and the spell ends.
If the attack hits, it deals an extra `1d4` thunder damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
It then becomes entrapped in a net of booming energy until the end of your next turn.
If the target makes any movement before then (willingly or unwillingly), it immediately takes `2d4` thunder damage.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
