## Description
You conjure a continuous bonfire inside a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
Any creature moves through the bonfire's space or ends its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity save or take `1d6` fire damage.
The flames do not require any fuel to burn throughout the spell's duration.

Once per round, you can flare up the bonfire as a bonus action, causing extra damage to creatures within the flames.
Those creatures must make the Saving Throw against the bonfire's damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level.
