## Description
You conjure a cloud of mites, fleas, or other such parasites, and provoke them to swarm upon one creature you can see within range.
The target takes `1d6` poison damage, and must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target can't take the *dash* action or any reactions until the end of your next turn, and for each point of damage that the target takes from this spell, it moves 5 feet in a random cardinal direction.
The target can't move a distance greater than its movement speed from this effect.
Attacks of opportunity caused by this movement have disadvantage.

The swarm loses interest and harmlessly dissipates at the end of your next turn.
